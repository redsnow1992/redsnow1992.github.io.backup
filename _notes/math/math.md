\begin{equation}
x=\sqrt{b}
\end{equation}

If \(a^2=b\) and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt{2} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt{2} \].

** Lord of the Rings
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
1. The attack of the Rohirrim
2. Eowyn’s fight with the witch king
+ this was already my favorite scene in the book
+ I really like Miranda Otto.
3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
- on DVD only
   He makes a really funny face when it happens.
   But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
   Important actors in this film are:
- Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
- Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo’s friend. I still remember
   him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
